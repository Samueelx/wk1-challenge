# WEEK 1: CODE CHALLENGE
## Description
---
This repository contains my solutions to the week 1 code challenges.
The solutions are in the **javascript** files.
## Project Setup
At the root of the project directory are two sub-directories (*css* and *solutions*) and four files. Inside the *css* directory is a file `style.css` and inside *solutions* directory are two files: `salary.js` and `speed.js`.

To run the tests for these solutions, you're going to need the following installed in your computer:
1. Visual Studio Code
2. Node.js
3. A web browser (preferably Google Chrome or Firefox Web Browser)
4. Git
5. Live Server Extention (Optional)

Technologies used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Node.js
5. Git

## Installation
- Open the terminal in your computer
- Clone the repository using : 

    `git clone git@github.com:Samueelx/wk1-challenge.git`

- change directory to the project repo :

    `cd w1-challenge`

- Open it in Visual studio code (or any editor of your choice)

    `code .`

### Running Challenge 1 Solution:
The solution to the first challenge is in the `index.js` file. To run/test the program, open the index.html file from your preferred browser and click on the *test* button. You should get a prompt in form of a pop-up.

### Running Challenge 2 Solution: 
The solution to the second challenge (Speed detector) is in the `solutions/speed.js` file. To run/test the program, open the terminal at the root of this project and run: `node solutions/speed.js`. To change the speed you should change the argument to the `speedDetector(arg)` function call.

### Running Challenge 3 solution:
The solution to the third challenge (Net Salary Calculator) is in the `solutions/salary.js` file. To run/test the program, open your terminal at the root of this project and run: `node solutions/salary.js`. To change the basic salary and benefits values, you can change the arguments to the `salaryCalculator(basicSalary, benefits)` function call.
